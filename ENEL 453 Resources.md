# ENEL 453 Resources

### Course Overview
- This course focuses on the design, implementation, and testing of digital systems using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) on an FPGA. You will learn to design combinational and sequential logic circuits, develop testbenches, and implement FSMs. This course is very hands-on, enabling you to work with real hardware and simulation tools, bridging theoretical concepts from ENEL 353 with practical digital systems.
